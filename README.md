# Typicode API test assignment

### Deployment on Vercel
https://typicode-test-sandy.vercel.app/

### Features
1. Sorting by name (sorting is done on the frontend because the API does not allow filtering and querying)
2. Pagination
3. Navigation

### Tech used:
1. React for UI
2. FSD architecture for slices and layers (you can find some slices from the documentation such as widgets, pages, shared elements etc.)
3. Wouter for routing (as a lightweight alternative for React Router)
4. SWR for data fetching and caching
5. Default CSS modules for styling
6. clsx for conditional class rendering

The app does not use state management because it's not actually required
